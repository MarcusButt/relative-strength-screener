Welcome to my Relative Strength Stock Screener. 

This application can be used to graph historical stock price movements and the relative strength (RS) of those stocks compared to the S&P 500.

The tool is intended to be used to identify stocks that are currently outperforming the broader market as indicated by their relative strength vs. the performance of the S&P 500. 
This can be either stocks growing faster than overall market in a bull market, or stocks that are holding flat in an overall bearish market. 
In both cases the stocks have been delivering better returns than the market as a whole and have therefore been exhibiting relative strength. 

A few definitions:

	Relative Strength: A relative strength comparison compares a security's price change with that of a "base" security or index. 
		   	   It is calculated by dividing a security's price by the price of the "base" security.
		   	   The result of this calculation is the ratio between both securities which can be used to compare their performance relative to one another over a given timeframe. 
			   If relative strength is increasing, then the chosen security's price has been performing better than the "base" security. 
			   If relative strength is decreasing, then the chosen security's price has been performing worse than the "base" security. 
			   If relative strength is flat, then the performance of the chosen security and the "base" security have been similar. 

	Simple Moving Average (MA): A moving average is a measure of a security's average price over a given timeframe. They are typically used to identify and act on trends in the market.
				    In addition to indicating the general trend of a market or security, moving averages can also be used to identify entry/exit levels and support/resistance points on a chart. 
				    The simple moving average places an equal weight on all of the price data in the given timeframe; therefore, it is more often used as a medium- to long-term tool. 	      

	Exponential Moving Average (EMA): An exponential moving average is much like a simple moving average, except that it puts more weight on the most recent price data causing it to react faster to price change. 
					  These moving averages typically use shorter time windows than simple moving averages.

	    Beneath the search bar there are buttons to toggle on/off each of the moving averages on the main price chart. 

Relative Strength Chart: This chart graphs the relative strength of the security indicated (dotted line) vs. the price of the S&P 500 index. 
			 It provides you with a snapshot of the security's performance against the movement of the broader market.
