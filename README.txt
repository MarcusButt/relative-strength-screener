Welcome to my Relative Strength Stock Screener. 

This application can be used to graph historical stock price movements and the relative strength (RS) of those stocks compared to the S&P 500.

The tool is intended to be used to identify stocks that are currently outperforming the broader market as indicated by their relative strength vs. the performance of the S&P 500. 
This can be either stocks growing faster than overall market in a bull market, or stocks that are holding flat in an overall bearish market. 
In both cases the stocks have been delivering better returns than the market as a whole and have therefore been exhibiting relative strength. 

A few definitions:

	Relative Strength: A relative strength comparison compares a security's price change with that of a "base" security or index. 

		   	   It is calculated by dividing a security's price by the price of the "base" security.

		   	   The result of this calculation is the ratio between both securities which can be used to compare their performance relative to one another over a given timeframe. 

			   If relative strength is increasing, then the chosen securities price has been performing better than the "base" security. 

			   If relative strength is decreasing, then the chosen securities price has been performing worse than the "base" security. 

			   If relative strength is flat, then the performance of the chosen security and the "base" security have been similar.
